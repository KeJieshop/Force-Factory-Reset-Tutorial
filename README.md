When do I need to force the factory settings to be restored?
1. I can turn on the computer, but only the boot screen is available, but I can't enter the system
2. The password is set, but forgotten
3. It can be turned on, but it enters the recovery mode
4. It can boot up and enter the system, but it will crash during use
