When do I need to force the factory settings to be restored?
1. I can turn on the tablet, but only the boot screen is available, but I can't enter the system
2. The password is set, but forgotten
3. I can turn on the tablet, but it enters the recovery mode
4. The tablet can boot up and enter the system, but it will crash during use
